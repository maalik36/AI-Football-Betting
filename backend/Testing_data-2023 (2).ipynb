      "### Explanation of the Table:\n",
      "\n",
      "The table above lists all NFL teams and their average `points_diff` from the 2021 and 2022 seasons. This metric serves as a proxy for their predicted overall team strength and expected performance in the 2023 season.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **`team`**: The name of the NFL team.\n",
      "*   **`avg_points_diff_2021_2022`**: The average difference between points scored and points allowed for that team across the 2021 and 2022 seasons. A higher positive number indicates a stronger historical performance.\n",
      "*   **`actual_2023_wins`**: The actual number of wins the team achieved in the 2023 season.\n",
      "*   **`actual_2023_losses`**: The actual number of losses the team sustained in the 2023 season.\n",
      "*   **`actual_2023_points_diff`**: The actual points differential for the team in the 2023 season.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How to Interpret:**\n",
      "\n",
      "If a team has a high `avg_points_diff_2021_2022`, it means they historically outscored their opponents by a significant margin. This suggests they were a strong team in the years leading up to 2023 and would therefore be \"predicted\" to perform well (i.e., win more games) in 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, the Kansas City Chiefs have the highest average points differential from 2021-2022, suggesting they were the strongest team leading into 2023, and indeed, they had a strong 2023 season (11 wins, +77 points diff). Conversely, the Houston Texans and New York Jets had very low or negative averages, indicating they were weaker teams, which largely aligns with their actual 2023 performance (7-10 for Jets, 10-7 for Texans showing significant improvement from prior years).\n",
      "\n",
      "This provides a reasonable \"prediction\" of overall team strength for the 2023 season based purely on the requested historical data, while acknowledging the impossibility of predicting specific game outcomes without a schedule.\n"
